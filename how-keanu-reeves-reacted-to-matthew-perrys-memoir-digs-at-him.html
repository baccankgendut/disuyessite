It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down. Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and <a href=#>Heath Ledger</a> die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?” the Massachusetts native wrote while addressing the death of their mutual friend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Keanu-Reeves-Confused-Bamboozled-About-Matthew-Perrys-Memoir-Digs.jpg><p>Perry took aim at Reeves again while discussing <a href=#>Chris Farley</a>’s December 1997 death, adding, “I punched a hole through <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a>’s dressing room wall when I found out [about Farley’s death].”</p><p>He noted in the section: “Keanu Reeves walks among us.”</p><p>Following backlash, the 17 Again actor <a href=#>issued a statement</a>, saying, “I’m actually a big fan of Keanu. I just chose a random name, my mistake. I apologize. I should have used my own name instead.”</p><p>In the memoir, which was released on Tuesday, November 1, Perry also claimed that he made out with <a href=#>Valerie Bertinelli</a> while she was still married.</p><p>“Valerie and I had a long, elaborate make-out session. It was happening — maybe she felt the same way I did. I told her I had thought about doing that for a long time, and she had said it right back to me,” the author detailed before recalling how the Food Network host, 62, “made no mention” of the alleged encounter the following morning. “I quickly got the hint and also played the role I was supposed to, but inside I was devastated.”</p><p>Bertinelli, for her part, seemingly reacted to Perry’s claims when she took to TikTok last month&nbsp;<a href=#>to share a video of herself cringing and waving</a> to <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>‘s song “Anti-Hero.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Anyone misbehave in their 20s and early 30s? Are you mortified?” she wrote in the clip as Swift, 32, sang, “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem. It’s me.”</p><p>For more on the aftermath of Perry’s memoir, watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6diuKatza5kq52Vq7K0edGemJyslZl6tbuMppitrJiaxG68xKupsqtdorKuu8irZJ2hl6h6osCMoaCmZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-exp-share-work-pokemon-unite.html><span>←</span><span>How does Exp.
