In fact, the row over Dobby's resemblance to Vladimir Putin may soon be at the centre of a courtroom battle.</p><p id=epvyAOqbVVN6 data-wc=43>According to press reports, a Russian law firm is preparing a case against the special effects team who created the little munchkin. They say the character should not have been based on a public figure, especially one of such importance of their premier.</p><p id=eFc7QXZDpP8y data-wc=74>It must be said that the resemblance between the two is limited: Vladimir, who is known to pride himself on his fitness and immaculate appearance, is not green, nor do his ears hang from the sides of his head like two great floppy wings. A poll in Russia asking whether people thought the two were similar received a resounding "yes" vote, however. In fact, nearly 80 percent said their president had distinctly Dobby-like features.</p><p id=exLHDN0jCh0P data-wc=60>Whether the case will go to court is another matter. Both Warner Brothers and the Kremlin have refused to comment so far, but it wouldn't be the first time a fictional monster has sparked a political row in Russia. In 1995, state prosecutors launched an investigation into the puppet show <i>Kukly</i> for insulting Boris Yeltsin. The case was later dropped.</p><p id=eLoBMsvbCu1L data-wc=53>A spokesman for the Russian Lawyers' Guild said a lawsuit was unlikely, but he didn't rule it out. "Similar suits have taken place," he admitted. "It's very difficult for courts to rule on them; lots of experts have to be called in… it seems to me it would be a long, drawn-out process."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
