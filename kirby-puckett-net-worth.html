Kirby played baseball at Calumet High School but received no scholarship offers after graduation. So he went to work on the Ford Motor Company assembly line before attending Bradley University. He then transferred to Triton College a year later. The five-foot-eight centerfielder played well enough to garner the interest of big league scouts.</p><h2 id=mlb-career><strong>MLB Career</strong></h2><p>With the third overall pick in the first round of the 1982 Major League Baseball January Draft-Regular Phase, Kirby Puckett was selected by the Minnesota Twins. He was assigned to their minor league system where he had success and flew through the ranks. He was promoted to the AAA Toledo Mud Hens in 1984 and brought up to the majors for good just 21 games into the season.</p><p>Puckett made his big league debut on May 8, 1984, against the California Angels. And within the first few years, he established himself as more than just a singles hitter. He played for the Twins his entire career until 1995 where he won two World Series Championships and an ALCS MVP. Kirby Puckett was a 10-time All-Star, and was recognized for his abilities at the plate and in the field with six Silver Slugger Awards and six Gold Glove Awards. He was the AL batting champion in 1989 and AL RBI leader in 1994. He received the <a href=# title="Roberto Clemente Net Worth">Roberto Clemente</a> Award in 1996.</p><p>Puckett was forced to retire after losing sight in one eye when he was 35. He finished his career with a .318 batting average, 2,304 hits, 207 home runs, and 1,085 RBIs. The Twins retired his No. 34, and he was enshrined into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame. Kirby Puckett was a first ballot Baseball Hall of Famer in 2001.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166303 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/GettyImages-97869719.jpg alt="Kirby Puckett" width=594 height=475 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-166303 class=wp-caption-text>Al Messerschmidt / Getty Images</p><h2 id=contracts-amp-career-earnings><strong>Contracts & Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>Puckett signed a three-year, $9 million contract with the Minnesota Twins in 1990.
