He referred specifically to his relationship with ex-wife Moss. "This is gonna sound so shallow, but I get lost in fantasy a lot," he said. "...The fantasy of this person from Mad Men, you know, great actress ... It is like being starstruck, and I was getting to know the other people from the show and her and it was very, very exciting, and I only got caught up in that part of it." He added, "This is something that's happened to me a million times."</p><p>Armisen admitted that after the initial rush of a relationship, he struggles to contend with the totality of the other person. "I have a problem with intimacy, where all of a sudden, there's a real person there ... and now, there's a person behind this ... It's almost like an amnesia," he said. "It's almost like waking up and going, 'Where am I? Who is this person? Why is this person looking at me directly in the eye and having a conversation with me?'"&nbsp;With an attitude like that, it's likely that "this person" won't be having a conversation with you for much longer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2tkaX5wv8eam7JlpKfCtbSMm5yhoZ6Zeqe%2BxJ1kmqqdnsCmuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronan-anthony-villency-bio-wiki-age-parents-girlfriend-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Ronan Anthony Villency Bio, Wiki, Age, Parents, Girlfriend and Net Worth</span></a>
