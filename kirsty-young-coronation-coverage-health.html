She was eventually diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in 2018, which triggered her secondary condition, fibromyalgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/999248489581-kirsty-young-bbc.jpg><p id=eWF_sN2Hszn data-wc=34>Fibromyalgia means your pain threshold doesn't work in the way it should, so even the tiniest knock can result in agony.
