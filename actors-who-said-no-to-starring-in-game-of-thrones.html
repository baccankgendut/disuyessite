In the 2012 interview with the publication, West said he didn't remember the exact name of the character, but only that it required him to relocate to Reykjavik, Iceland for six months. HuffPost deduced that the role may have been King Beyond the Wall Mance Rayder in Season 3, but that hasn't been confirmed.</p><p dir=ltr>"My nephew and his father said, 'Gosh, Game of Thrones is the only great show on!' And I felt terrible, because I'd just turned them down," West told HuffPost. "My problem is, I've got four kids, and at the moment, I'm reluctant to be away from home for a long time. I can get a lot of work in London and still be at home."</p><p dir=ltr>Instead, West starred as presenter Hector Madden on the <a href=#>BBC 1950s period drama The Hour</a>, starring alongside Ben Whishaw and Romola Garai. West received a <a href=#>Golden Globe nomination</a> for the role, so he can't be all that upset about passing on the HBO hit.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5paYN3e8Ccq6iqo2LEqbuMrJiinF2jvG7AzmaqrZmip7avs4yipWafkaKybrvFZquhqp%2BjsrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./21-jump-street-actress-brittney-algers-wiki-pitch-perfect-married-husband-bio-550227-html.html><span>←</span><span>21 Jump Street actress Brittney Algers Wiki: Pitch Perfect, Married, Husband, Bio</span></a>
