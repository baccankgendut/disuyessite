"Me and the #1 car had a bit of an issue getting into [turn] one there," Davey Callihan told Race 22.</p><p>Callihan spoke "I felt like I was inside enough there for him to give him a little more room than he did. He kinda pinched me down there and I just didn't give an inch. You gotta fight for your life, for a transfer spot to get in the show."</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Callihan was not suprised</h2><p>He elaborated "Unfortunately, we locked tires and it wheel hopped me onto him. It is what it is. Obviously, he wasn't too pumped on it. So, he decided to throw a few shots inside the car."</p><p>"But, that's water under the bridge, we're going to race the ValleyStar 300."</p><p>Andrew Grady has had nothing to say.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqeYrJuRp3xzfJFrZmlxX2eCcIKSa52camKXf3OCj2qbcXBnm4WjgJRym2egpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monday-night-raw-results.html><span>←</span><span>monday night raw results - Page 3 of 3</span></a>
