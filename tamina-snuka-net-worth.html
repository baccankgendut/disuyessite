She first debuted on Monday Night RAW on May 24, 2010. She is the daughter of legendary pro wrestler Jimmy Snuka and also related to Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.</p><p><strong>Birthdate: </strong>Jan. 10, 1978</p><p><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Vancouver, Wash.</p><p><strong>Birth name: </strong>Sarona Moana-Marie Reiher Snuka</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Jimmy Snuka</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Sharon Snuka</p><p><strong>Marriages: </strong>Brandon Polamalu (m. 1995, div. 2003)​</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>two daughters, Milaneta and Maleata</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How is Tamina Snuka related to The Rock?</h2><p>Both Jimmy Snuka and The Rock's father married into the Anoa'i family, which is how Tamina became connected. Fellow WWE superstar Nia Jax is also related to the creator of The People's Eyebrow, albeit a bit more closely. Her dad, Joseph Fanene, was directly related to Peter Maivia, The Rock's grandfather.</p><p>In the early days of The Rock's career, he was even billed as Rocky Maivia, a head nod to both his dad and connection to the Anoa'i family. He would go on to become arguably the most successful pro wrestler of all time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Rock has shared his wealth with his cousin, Tamina Snuka.</h2><p>In a viral video the Red Notice star posted online, he can be seen covering Tamina's eyes and walking her into a fully furnished house. He kisses her on the back of the head and then removes his hand and the WWE star is immediately overcome with emotion.</p><p>While a ton of people gave props to The Rock for gifting the house, it soon started a conversation about how wrestlers are being paid in the WWE.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Some folks wondered if there was a wage gap between female and male performers. Others just thought pro wrestlers in general probably weren't making enough to make ends meet.</p><p>It's a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">well-known fact</a> that many wrestlers' contracts stipulate they must cover their own rentals, hotel rooms, and food while traveling from venue to venue. However, airfare is covered.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Some who responded to The Rock's gesture questioned why he would buy a home for someone who is already gainfully employed. This ultimately lead to a back-and-forth with rejoinders from individuals stating that it was still an extremely generous thing for The Rock to do, regardless of her financial situation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So if you already have something... someone else can’t get you another one or a better one?
