In a quest to beat rival Good Morning America‘s ratings, NBC is shaking things up at the morning show.</p><p>Co-hosts <strong>Willie Geist</strong> and <strong>Natalie Morales </strong>“were recently told they were fired,” an NBC source reveals exclusively in the new issue of <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong>. Morales, 42, is now in talks with ABC and Geist, 39, has lined up a gig at CBS, the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>But soon after those radical cuts were made, NBC removed general manager <strong>Jamie Horowitz</strong>, the most vocal proponent of the changes. In a memo obtained by <strong>Us Weekly</strong>, NBC News’ <strong>Deborah Turness</strong> explained Horowitz — on the job since September — was simply “not the right fit.” Now it’s unclear whether Geist and Morales will indeed be exiting or whether the current regime will try to woo them back.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The insider adds that there are other ideas “floating around” as well, including demoting fellow co-host <strong>Tamron Hall </strong>back to MSNBC and adding Good Morning America alum <strong>Josh Elliott</strong> as a newsreader.&nbsp;<strong>Hoda Kotb</strong>, who currently owns the 10 a.m. hour with <strong>Kathie Lee Gifford</strong>, might also be asked to join the 9 a.m. hour.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A separate source, however, tells <strong>Us</strong> that these proposals may never come to fruition. “An executive went rogue and got fired for suggesting crazy ideas no one agreed with,” the source explains of the situation overall.&nbsp;</p><p>A rep for the Today show also denies the shake-up and tells <strong>Us </strong><strong>in a statement</strong>, “NBC’s Today has the best anchor team in morning television. The entire Today show anchor team — Matt Lauer, Savannah Guthrie, Al Roker, Natalie Morales, Willie Geist, Carson Daly, Tamron Hall, Kathie Lee Gifford, and Hoda Kotb — are incredibly talented, valued and have our support. In response to the false rumors that have been circulated about our anchor team, NBC wants to be absolutely clear: The rumors are wrong — period. This is the team we are committed to. And this is the team that our viewers turn to in the morning.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOp5itmZyesm65zquYpZ2jYsSquMuinGaflZ7AtXnFoqmenF2bv7C5jK2mnZmpYsCpu9Zmm56skZ65tHmRaWhtaWlmfg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./molly-sims-bio-marriage-husband-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Molly Sims Bio: Marriage, Husband &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
