She has turned her pain into purpose and led through compassion and willpower, showing others that the impossible is indeed possible.

Ellie, you embody the Invictus spirit for your selfless service, you know that sport doesn't just save lives, it transforms them for the better. And in finding your own cure, you have helped countless brothers and sisters in staying alive."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/811462b045a8-gettyimages-530627360.jpg><p id=eGqWAv-OUGz data-wc=57>Harry founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international multi-sport event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women, both serving and veterans.
