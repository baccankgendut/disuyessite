前年の1999年に交際が発覚した時点で、多くのファンが悶絶していた話題ですが、1年後に結婚とトドメを刺された格好です。
スマップという大型アイドルグループのエースという立場から、結婚後は家庭内の話や子供の話題は一切ありませんでした。
木村さんの本来の性格からすると、自分の家でのことを隠したい気持ちはなさそうですが、そこは女性ファンを気遣っての事務所の方針ですね。
しかし、2020年代になると、娘が音楽家としてデビューしたり、モデルとして海外のハイブランドのアンバサダーに就任したりと、ファミリー感溢れる話題が増えました。
SMAPのメンバーではなくなった影響もあると思いますが、木村さんも以前よりも家庭の話をする機会が増えました。
現在になって遡って注目されるのは、木村さんと工藤静香さんの結婚当時のことや、出産後の子育てです。
木村拓哉と工藤静香の結婚式の写真がダイニングソファーの裏側に？ kokiさんとcocomiさんのインスタライブを見てると、家庭内でのキムタクの質問が尽きず、娘が過去のお父さんの様子を語るとその内容がそのままYahoo!ニュースのトップになったりもします。
また、SNS経由で公開される木村拓哉さんの自宅の写真も、ネットの話題になることが多いです。
実は2020年に木村さんがインスタでジャニーズの後輩の山下智久さんと亀梨和也さんが遊びに来た当時の写真を投稿し、その写真から意外な素顔が発覚したのです。
山Pと亀梨さんと木村さんがダイニングのソファーでくつろいでる写真なのですが、そのソファーのすぐ後ろの棚に木村拓哉さんと工藤静香さんの結婚式の写真が飾られていたのです！
この写真だけを見てると「なんで結婚式の写真だってわかるの？」と疑問に思うことでしょう。
実は過去、木村さんが自宅のリビングソファー付近で撮影された写真のほとんど、後ろの壁にモザイク加工がされているのです。
日頃はモザイク加工されているソファー裏の壁ですが、一度だけモザイク加工が甘く、どんな写真が飾ってあるのかわかってしまう投稿があったのです。
嫁・工藤静香の誕生日にアップされた写真の背後に結婚式の写真が！ 常にボカシやモザイクの加工がされている自宅ソファーの後ろですが、一度だけ加工が甘く、写真の一部がバレてしまう写真がアップされたました。
それがこの写真です↓
これだけだとよくわからないですね。
アップにしてみると、タキシードやドレスを着ている人が写ってる写真だとわかります。
明らかに二人の結婚式の写真です。
これには当時のファンが「工藤静香がわざとやった！」などプチ炎上しました。
微博(weibo)では海外ファン向けに嫁・工藤静香との家族写真? 昨今、家族模様などがニュースになることが多い木村拓哉さん。
日本で話題になるケースでは、嫁の工藤静香さんか、娘のkokiさん、cocomiさんのSNS発信であることがほとんどです。
やはり、国内向きのSNSではファンに気を遣っているようです。
そんな木村拓哉さんも中国版のツイッターと呼ばれている「微博(weibo)ウィブロ」では、国内向けとは違ったアプローチで投稿してるようです。
一番驚くべきは、2020年に嫁・工藤静香さんとの夫婦ツーショットの写真を公開したことです。
日本のファンも、一応はニュースで知るので、一部では”配慮に欠ける”など言われていましたが・・・。
木村拓哉が工藤静香の誕生日にラブラブツーショットで祝福！ 木村拓哉さんがウィブロで嫁・工藤静香さんとのツーショットを公開したのは2020年の4月14日。
静香夫人の誕生日のことです。
自宅に飾ってる結婚式の写真がバレた投稿と一緒ですね。
この投稿に対して、現地の中国のファンが大勢反応していました。（SMAPは中国でも人気のグループで、木村さん個人も大人気です。）
一方で日本のファンは海外向けにアットホーム感を出してることと、この写真で結婚式の写真を自宅に飾っていることに対する嫉妬の反応が凄まじかったです。
日本と中国の国民性の違いを見た瞬間でもありました。
娘のkokiとcocomiによる家族写真が素敵？お父さんがキムタクという幸せ 木村さんと工藤さんが家族関係の写真を投稿をすると嫉妬の反応がすごいです。
すでに結婚して20年以上経ってる夫婦だというのに、改めてそれを実感するのはファンにとって苦痛なのでしょうか？
一方で、娘のkokiさんとcocomiさんのお父さん関係の投稿に関しては好反応が多い印象です。
過去に、お父さんの好きな作品や感想を語ったり、幼少期のお父さんとのエピソードを語ったりした際は、ネットニュースに取り上げられるほどの反応がありました。
特に人気なのは、子供の頃にお父さんと一緒に撮ったとされる写真ですね！
お父さんの誕生日に幼少期の家族写真を投稿して人気に！ 家族の誰かの誕生日にはSNSで祝福をし合う木村一家。
家でもみんなリビングダイニングに留まり、ワイワイと会話を楽しんでるというから、仲の良さはガチです。
娘の過去の投稿には、”いつも楽しませてくれて”という言葉がありましたが、それだけ自宅でも明るく楽しい父であることがわかります。
ドラマ現場でも末端のスタッフまでに声をかけておしゃべりを楽しんでる木村さんの陽気な人間性が、一家に日差しを当ててるように感じます。
そんな素敵なお父さんが支える仲良し家族ですが、父の誕生日に娘が家族写真を投稿して大反響を呼んだことがありました。
↓2021年の木村さんの誕生日の11月13日に、次女のkokiさんのインスタ投稿です。
Instagramに幼少期の家族写真を投稿し、木村さんを祝福していました。
Cocomiさんは家族4人がケーキを囲んで顔を寄せ合う写真や、木村さんの頬に顔を寄せる写真など5枚と、自身が赤ちゃんの時の動画を投稿。「ベストフレンドの誕生日～！HAPPY BIRTHDAY」とつづった。
2020年の木村さんの誕生日にも写真を投稿し、「いつまでもカッコイイ父上でいてください（言わずともそうであろうけど）。父上且つ親友」と呼びかけていた。
koki，さんも家族4人で木村さんの誕生日を祝う写真や姉妹と木村さんの3ショットの写真など3枚を投稿し、「Happy Birthday Dad !!!!!! We love you so much お誕生日おめでとういつもありがとう」と感謝の気持ちをつづっていた。</description></item><item><title>AGT: Was Skilyr Hicks Missing, How Did She Die?

Answer
The flywheel is attached to the crankshaft at the back by bolts. You will almost likely be impossible to spin the flywheel over by hand unless you have removed the spark plugs from the engine (to reduce compression) before starting the engine. In order to “jog” the motor, you’ll need to utilise the starter.

Aside from that, how do you spin an engine manually?</description></item><item><title>Dagen McDowell Biography: Net Worth, Instagram, Age, Husband, Photos, Children</title><link>/dagen-mcdowell-biography-net-worth-instagram-age-husband-photos-children.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dagen-mcdowell-biography-net-worth-instagram-age-husband-photos-children.html</guid><description>Dagen McDowell is an esteemed anchor and financial journalist recognized for her exceptional contributions to the media field.
