<a href=../../../../what-happens-when-dryer-vent-falls-off-html.html></a>
Answer
If either side of the vent hose (vent hose on dryer side or vent hose on wall side) comes loose, hot air exhaust will flood the room and lint may be seen on the floor as a result. Lint may accumulate in your clothes dryer over time if you do not have a vent hose connected to it.
