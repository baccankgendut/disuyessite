I’ve never really read an issue of Health cover to cover but I ignorantly assumed they dealt with physical health. Based on Busy’s interview, it sounds like they deal with all forms of health, which means I should have been reading all along – sorry Health. Anyway, Busy covers the latest issue and she looks fantastic. I love that bathing suit she’s wearing. She should wear red all the time.</p><p>The magazine released a few quotes in front of the issue’s release and they tackle everything from anxiety to Instagram. Busy also talked about the fact that marriage can be tough and that it takes work, just like anything else.</p><p><strong>Busy on Anxiety:</strong> I grew up in a family where mental health issues are…we’ve got ’em! I’ve had that since I was a kid—racing thoughts, unable to get control of my thoughts, spinning out into paralysis of not being able to do anything and crying hysterically about it, or just feeling totally helpless.</p><p><strong>Busy on marriage:</strong> “I’ve been vocal that marriage is not easy. It’s complicated. We had a really hard summer [last year], with him directing [I Feel Pretty]—and the specifics of what that is and what that means, I don’t think is super important, publicly, to get into. Everyone is working and struggling to make it work, you know? But I think being honest about how difficult marriage is, and succeeding in long-term relationships is—I think that’s a great conversation to be had.”</p><p><strong>Busy on keeping her relationship successful:</strong> Complete honesty is key for us. We’re just in a place where we’re incredibly open and honest with one another about literally everything. It took us years to get to that place—and some of it was f—ing brutal, you know? And like, not great—you don’t wanna hear it! But it really is incredibly helpful, ’cause [your partner knows] you better than anyone, probably. I like being very open and honest. And sometimes that means saying, “I’m sorry,” and sometimes that means saying, like, “I need you to say, ‘I’m sorry.’”</p><p><strong>Busy on what she doesn’t post on Instagram:</strong> People are like, “Your girls always look so sweet,” and I’m like, “Yeah, because I’m not gonna post their horrible moments for you to see!” That’s not fair to them. And there’s some private stuff that I don’t talk too intensely about. There’s stuff with Marc and our relationship that I don’t think is appropriate for me to put out publicly because of my children.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Health]</a></p><p>Everything Busy said is true and yet, rarely heard in celebrity interviews. More often, they try to sell the idea that their relationships are the stuff of fairytales and their bonds are so strong, they just “never fight.” If that’s true – congratulations. But my guess would be more people can identify with what Busy or <a href=#>Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard</a> say about their relationship. I think most couples have gone through a difficult patch. It sounds like Busy and Marc made it through their last summer. Good for them.</p><p>Her comments about Instagram are interesting. Busy gets a lot of flak for her Instagram posts, even though she’s admitted that’s <a href=# title="Busy Philipps admits she makes more money on Instagram than acting">her main source</a> of income. Maybe she deserves it. But I appreciate anyone who admits they curate their social media to show a better life than what they live.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn34342581-682x1024.jpg alt=wenn34342581 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn34239495-675x1024.jpg alt=wenn34239495 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn34072855-686x1024.jpg alt=wenn34072855 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: Health Magazine and WENN Phtos</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbnBhaX1xe8GuqrKXoJ22rbjIqaqYpZGnv6qtxp6WoquPo7y1q8SaqrKXp5qsqa3DmJiYqpWWua3FvqGYq5yPqMKuucSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-tyler-vorce-age-wiki-biography-height-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Billie Eilish Boyfriend Matthew Tyler Vorce Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Instagram, Net Worth</span></a>
