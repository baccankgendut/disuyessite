The most perfect day ever,” captioned the photograph.</p><p>For her big day, the 32-year-old wore a satin dress that hugged her body before flaring out below the knees.</p><p>The dress also featured spaghetti straps and a low back, which had a hood attached to it. She wore her hair in an up-do with some strands left out to frame her face, while her makeup was done by Sydney makeup artist Leah Baines.</p><p>Meanwhile, Woodroffe wore an off-white suit and bright white sneakers.</p><p>Hundreds of celebrities and influencers rushed to congratulate the couple, who share son Jax, on their nuptials, including Steph Claire Smith, Martha Kalifatidis and Bec Judd.</p><p>The couple were first linked in 2021 before their engagement in July 2022, following Itsines’ shock 2020 split from ex-fiance Tobi Pearce, with whom she shares daughter Arna Leia, 3.</p><p>“Meet Jae, everyone! My best friend for years and now, partner,” Itsines captioned a photo of the pair.</p><p>“For all those people replying to my stories saying ‘you look really happy’ … thank you! I am,” she later updated the caption to read.</p><p>Itsines and Pearce, with whom she founded app and fitness business Sweat, were together for eight years before calling it quits in August 2020, 16 months after announcing their engagement.</p><p>“After eight years, Tobi and I have come to the difficult decision to separate as a couple. We will always be family, and remain good friends and devoted parents to Arna,” Itsines posted at the time.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“We have grown up together in Adelaide, sharing a lifetime of experiences and special memories from moving into our first apartment and starting SWEAT from our lounge room to becoming parents to our beautiful daughter.</p><p>“Our friendship remains strong as we parent Arna together and run SWEAT as business partners. Thank you for your support and kindness during this time.”</p><p>The former couple sold the business three years ago, before recently buying it back for an undisclosed sum.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Adelaide data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Adelaide</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9Geo5qsmaS7tLTIqapopZGnv6qtxp5mqZ2iqLyvrctmq6uZmaOys3nKmrClmV2ewbS1zZ6qZqyZmsBuwMeeZKSmn6l6qrqMm5yaraSes7a4jJycq52dpLu6e82erqxlo6m8s8WOb2tynWhur3Kyl2qYmpyVm695go%2Baa5tvYZuAon6Ucmw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./penn-badgley.html><span>←</span><span>Penn Badgley Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
