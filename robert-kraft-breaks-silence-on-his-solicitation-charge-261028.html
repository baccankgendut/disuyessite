The man released an official statement, apologizing and claiming that he actually has ‘extraordinary respect for women.’</p><p>In case you are not up to speed, the reason why he felt the needs to say that is that he was charged with soliciting prostitution.</p><p>Despite this, Kraft pleaded ‘not guilty.’</p><p>Regardless, the authorities say that actually, there is surveillance camera footage that shows the man being intimate during two of his visits to a massage parlor in Jupiter, Florida.</p><p>At this time, he faces up to one year behind bars if he gets convicted.</p><p>He started by arguing that his silence for the past few weeks was in ‘defense&nbsp;of the&nbsp;judicial process.’</p><p>‘To correct some of the misinformation surrounding the matter, my attorney made the first public comments on Friday night. I’d like to use this opportunity to say something I have wanted to say for four weeks. I’m truly sorry.’</p><p>He went on to say that he was&nbsp;well aware of how much he disappointed his loved ones but also pals, co-workers, and fans!</p><p>Kraft was not the only one in this situation since 15 other men were also caught during the investigation and charged.</p><p>There are also others who were accused of running the prostitution ring.</p><p>‘Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women; my morals and soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years,’ Kraft added.</p><p>In the end, he made it clear that he hopes he will one day regain people’s respect and forgiveness since all he wants is to continue using his platform to make a difference.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘I expect to be judged not by my words, but by my actions,’ Kraft also mentioned.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipK%2BmvtNmoquZlql6o77EmqKsZaOeuaa6wp5kqKZdnba0edKoo6KbmamutbXOp2ScoJGntKZ5kW9oaWpoZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samantha-fenty.html><span>←</span><span>Rihanna Sister- Samantha Fenty Relationships, Net Worth, Songs</span></a>
