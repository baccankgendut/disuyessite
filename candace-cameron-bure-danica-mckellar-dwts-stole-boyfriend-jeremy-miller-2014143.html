Full House alum <strong>Candace Cameron Bure </strong>and Wonder Years star<strong> Danica McKellar </strong>will be competing against each other on Season 18 of Dancing With the Stars, but it turns out they've already battled each other before — over an ex-boyfriend!</p><p>"Candace had a run-in with Danica and told her she was the reason she split with her old boyfriend," a source exclusively tells <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> of the playful banter between the former child stars. "She used to date <strong>Jeremy Miller</strong> from Growing Pains years ago, but he broke up with her to date Danica."</p><p>The romance, however, didn't last. In fact, neither of the ladies ended up with the Growing Pains star, now 37. Bure, now 37, is married to Russian NHL hockey player <strong>Valeri Bure</strong>, with whom she has three children. McKellar, now 39, is currently single after finalizing her divorce from composer <strong>Mike Verta</strong> in February 2013, with whom she has one son. Miller, meanwhile, has three children with his wife, Joanie.</p><p>Though McKellar may have won the first round, Bure seems to be ready for some more friendly competition on DWTS.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Full House star told reporters at the Muppets: Most Wanted Hollywood premiere on March 11, that she was excited to see the Wonder Years alum on ABC's reality dance competition show. "Danica and I have known each other since we were 11 or 12 years old," she explained.</p><p>Tune in to the Season 18 premiere of Dancing With the Stars to see Bure and McKellar compete for the Mirror Ball trophy on Monday, March 17 at 8:00 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnJinnJGYsm6vwKacq6eeYq%2B2vsRmm5qmmZiubrnCpJylpJGneqXD06xkrKyfobJurs6ynauhlaOxbrbEq5ymsV2itq24xKtka2hhaX51fw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./busy-phillips-marriage-is-not-easy-we-had-a-really-hard-summer.html><span>←</span><span>Busy Philipps: Marriage is not easy.
