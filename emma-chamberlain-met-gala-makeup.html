First, she started with <a href=#>CeraVe’s hydrating toner</a>, then <a href=#>the brand’s beloved lightweight moisturizer</a> and lastly, the prep was finished off with <a href=#>an $11 de-puffing eye cream</a>. We love a fiscally responsible Gilded Age moment.</p><p>But, the one thing we’re writing down in bold red pen—and then highlighting for future reference—is a bronzer and blush collab that we didn’t even know existed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Unknown.jpeg><h2 class="css-11zrkxf e65zztl0" data-comp="DisplayName StyledComponent BaseComponent "><span class="css-1pgnl76 e65zztl0" data-at=product_name data-comp="StyledComponent BaseComponent ">Gen Nude Blonzer Blush + Bronzer</span></h2><p>After building up Emma’s gorg eye look with <a href=# rel=nofollow>BareMinerals eyeshadow palettes</a>, Deenihan used the brand’s coveted Blonzer (that’s bronzer and blush combined, for those asking). The celeb MUA said this one item is the quintessential summertime goodie we all need to achieve the popular glowing looks we keep seeing on TikTok and IRL.</p><p>“It’s so <span>gorgeous on the cheeks and you can put it on your eyes,” Deenihan explained. “It almost looks like the color of heat in the eyeshadow we used, so the look was all very cohesive.”</span></p><p>There’s truly nothing better than <a href=# rel=nofollow>a two-in-one moment</a>. Especially when it can be used wherever you want, from your eyelids to your cheeks.</p><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Gen Nude Blonzer Blush + Bronzer</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$25</span></p><p>BRB while I apply this life-changing product to every nook and cranny of my body there is.</p><p>Also, pro-tip for once you grab a Blonzer of your own: “<span>What helps longevity with your look is to really take your time and go in layers not just go straight out of the gate,” Deenihan said. “This way, the makeup really penetrates the skin.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYmuAeX%2BUaJympZFisKmtzJucq6SRnrtuucStZKCZnJZ6rq3KnqypZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-hardees-still-have-the-monster-burger-html.html><span>←</span><span>Does Hardees still have the monster burger?</span></a>
