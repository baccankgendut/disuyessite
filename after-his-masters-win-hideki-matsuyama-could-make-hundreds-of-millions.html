It's the first major of the year, nationally televised in primetime, and always held at the same course in Augusta. The winner receives a nice payday, ample prestige, and a green jacket, presented by the previous year's winner. No wonder the event's slogan is "a tradition unlike any other."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>Hideki Matsuyama</a> was the winner of this year's Masters. His -10 finish netted him $2,070,000 in winnings. Second place finisher Will Zalatoris, who was one stroke behind Matsuyama, made $1,240,000, which is almost double his career earnings prior to the Masters.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before this year's final round teed off, Andy North estimated a win for Matsuyama, who started the day in first place, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>would be worth $1 billion</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to the Action Network, Matsuyama is probably more in line for about $200 million for the rest of his career. Already, Matsuyama's net worth sits at about $35 million.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-318718 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1312346508.jpg alt width=900 height=522 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-318718 class=wp-caption-text>Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Why such a huge payday?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Golf is a huge deal in Japan, with more than 3,000 courses across the island country. Matsuyama is now the biggest face in his home country.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He's in line to receive some extra sponsorship dollars as a result of bringing extra exposure to a handful of brands. Most notable is Sumitomo Rubber. The Japanese company owns nearly every part of Matsuyama's "game day" attire. They own Srixon, which makes Matsuyama's clubs. They also own Cleveland Golf, which adorns his hat and golf bag. They're a licensor of Descente clothing, which Matsuyama was wearing at Augusta.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sumitomo Rubber is also the only distributor of Asics golf shoes in the United States. Guess what kind of shoes Matsuyama wears?</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Beyond a potentially lucrative deal with Sumitomo on the horizon, Matsuyama has also sparked additional interest in golf in his home country. That could lead to teaching courses, licensing deals, and other opportunities. Matsuyama is likely one of the favorites to light the Olympic torch this summer in Tokyo, too.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for runner-up Zalatoris, he made over a million dollars despite </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>not officially being on the PGA Tour</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. The second-place finisher has seen his full status delayed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, he's allowed to participate in PGA Tour events thanks to an exemption. If he wins an event, he'll vault to Tour status. With how well he's played already, he'd be in the top 15 in the FedEx Cup standings. At the end of the season, the top golfer in those standings nets $15 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He already has sponsorship deals with Titleist, Footjoy, and Simmons Bank. And there could be even more to come.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Masters truly is a tradition unlike any other. For those at the top, it can be a windfall unlike any other, too.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqdrZ2iYrWqv4ymmKyslafAbsPIp2ShoZSauKp5zJqrrK2plrqiecKorKWcXaKurLGMoaynnKKasbR5zp9kpqGcobawutJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1994-2004-nbc-sitcom-set-in-new-york-city-html.html><span>←</span><span>1994-2004 NBC sitcom set in New York City</span></a>
