Various people&nbsp;have pointed out the physiological traits that so obviously identify the ethnicity of the British royal.</p><p>Evidence has been obtained&nbsp;suggesting that&nbsp;Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, a Black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. According to a&nbsp;PBS.org&nbsp;article, The Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families, these&nbsp;speculations were confirmed by two art historians who suggested that mysterious paintings of&nbsp;the Black magi must have been portraits of actual people from that time because&nbsp;the artist would not have been aware of the subtleties in coloring and facial bone structure of quadroons or octoroons.&nbsp;Six different lines can be traced from England’s Queen Charlotte back to de Castro y Sousa, in a gene pool, which because of royal inbreeding, was already minuscule, thus explaining the queen’s unmistakable African appearance.</p><p align=left><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Queen-Victoria-600x338.jpg alt="Queen Victoria" width=600 height=338 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p align=left><b>Queen Victoria (May 24, 1819 – Jan. 22, 1901)<br></b></p><p align=left>If Queen Charlotte was of African ancestry, then Queen Victoria, her granddaughter, would have also had African blood,&nbsp;and, according to the discriminative “one drop rule” used historically for racial classification, may also be considered a Black person.</p><a href=# class=post-page-numbers>Next Page</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX52e49xZmlsX216psHRqKeemZ5iuKq6xqxkqq2Vmru0ec2omaWdnZq7bq%2FOp6qinJWnsqV5waWYnKNdpLumecOrpqlloqq5pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zendaya-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Zendaya Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
