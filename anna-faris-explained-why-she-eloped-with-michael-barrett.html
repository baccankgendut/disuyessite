After deciding to quietly get married to <strong>Michael Barrett</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Anna Faris</strong></a> discussed the reason behind her decision.</p><p>“With a little bit of age, you don’t need the whole thing,” Faris, 44, told <a href=#>Page Six</a> on Monday, August 23.</p><p>The Mom alum, who was first linked to Barrett, 51, in October 2017, added that “it was just us” during the special milestone.</p><p>The actress confirmed in February 2020 that she was engaged to the cinematographer, whom she met while working on the movie Overboard. Her former costar <a href=#><strong>Allison Janney</strong></a> <a href=#>exclusively confirmed the news to Us Weekly one month prior.</a></p><p>“I know she’s been engaged for a long time. I kept it very quiet, I’ll have you know! So, I celebrated with them a long time ago,” she told Us in January 2020. “I didn’t know he was going to propose, but I saw the ring one day. I went into her room to work on lines [for the show], and then I was like, ‘What is that ring on your finger?’ … I think she was waiting for everyone to notice. ‘Oh, that’s it,’ and then … yeah, it was fun.”</p><p>Late last month, Faris <a href=#>accidentally revealed that she eloped with Barrett</a> during an episode of her “Anna Faris is Unqualified” podcast.</p><p>“I think we’ve spent the last year in a place of reflection, in a place of kind of prioritization to some degree, a place of anxiety, a place of like, whatever, assessment. But I’m looking around, just so, just my fiancé’s right … he’s now my husband,” the House Bunny star shared with her guest <a href=#><strong>Gail Simmons</strong></a> in July about the private courthouse ceremony.</p><p>Faris realized her slip-up at the time and apologized for sharing the news without letting her husband know.</p><p>“Yes, we eloped … I’m sorry. I didn’t know … I’m sorry, honey. I just blurted that out, but it just feels [like] I can’t say fiancé anymore,” she said, noting that the wedding was “awesome” and “it feels great” to be married again.</p><p>The Scary Movie actress was previously married to <strong>Ben Indra</strong> from 2004 to 2008 and later <a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a> from 2009 to 2018. Faris and Pratt share 8-year-old son Jack.</p><p>The Maryland native <a href=#>previously reflected on her prior relationships and why they didn’t work out at the time.</a></p><p>“My two other marriages were with actors and I don’t think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness,” Faris admitted in a March episode of her podcast. “Or at least I didn’t, being a proud person and not wanting to reveal vulnerability.”</p><p>Two months later, the podcast host elaborated on not feeling like she had a tight group of friends with whom <a href=#>she could discuss the issues she was going through.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn’t have,” she added, <a href=#>noting that those experiences “stunted” her in “a lot of ways.”</a></p><p>“One of them being that I never talked about any issues, so to the people, even who I was closest to, I’m sure things were more transparent with my relationship with [first husband] Ben [Indra], but with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles,” Faris detailed in May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6Weqet0aKqZp2opbmitc2em2avmK56tLTEZpylp6CasW7DyK2fZqWZmLWisctmmZqqoprBtXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spider-man-no-way-home-trailer-angourie-rices-betty-brant-makes-a-return.html><span>←</span><span>Angourie Rice's Betty Brant Makes a Return</span></a>
