Applegate first shared her MS diagnosis back in August 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I haven't slept for 24 hours because my eye is doing something weird, where every time I close my eye to go to sleep, my right eye starts to shift like this," Applegate said. "My legs have never been this bad, so I don’t know what’s going on, like, no energy, legs are just done, like, can’t get circulation, I can’t get them to stop hurting."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Applegate added that she has reached out to her medical team and is waiting for their response.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Critics Choice Association</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress went on to say that her current situation is taking a toll on her mental health as well as her physical health. She noted that she's experiencing a deep depression. She also explained that she's had to use Cottonelle instead of taking a proper shower and feels defeated on every level.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2022, a year after she shared her diagnosis, Applegate opened up about her health in a profile for the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Times</a>. Even after surviving breast cancer, Applegate said that MS would show the world a side of her it had never seen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is the first time anyone's going to see me the way I am," she said.
