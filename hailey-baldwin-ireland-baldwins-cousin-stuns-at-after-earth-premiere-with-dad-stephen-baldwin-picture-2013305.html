On Wednesday, May 29, <strong>Stephen Baldwin</strong>'s youngest daughter wowed the crowd at the Mercedes-Benz hosted New York City premiere of After Earth, starring <a href=#><strong>Will</strong></a> and <strong>Jaden Smith</strong>.</p><p>Arriving at the Ziegfeld Theater before the movie, the blonde stunner rocked a short, fitted, black-and-white frock with sky-high nude platform heels. She was accompanied by her dad — the youngest of the four Baldwin brothers, behind Alec, <strong>Daniel</strong>, and <strong>William</strong> — who wore a black suit, blue T-shirt, and dark sunglasses.</p><p>"After Earth is an amazing movie and if you don't go see it there's something wrong with you. @officialjaden kills it!" Hailey <a href=#>tweeted</a> after the premiere, giving a shout-out to Jaden Smith.</p><p>Jaden, 14, is dating <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>, 15, who is a friend of Hailey's. Earlier in the week, Kylie and Hailey met up with a few other pals for pizza in New York's West Village.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Day with my girls," Kylie <a href=#>tweeted</a> on Tuesday, May 28, along with a link to a picture of the stylish group.</p><p>Hailey is Stephen Baldwin's daughter with wife <strong>Kennya Baldwin</strong>, whom he married in 1990. The couple also have an older daughter, <strong>Alaia</strong>, 20. Both girls are said to be close with Ireland.</p><p>Speaking about their famous family in an interview with <a href=#>Page Six Magazine</a> last September, Alaia explained the bond between the younger Baldwin cousins. "No matter how much you think you understand a Baldwin, you really don't unless you are one," she said. "Ireland and I pretty sane for Baldwins."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BaoZyaxm6uwKWbsKGeYrazscuapZ1lkpa5pcPIp6pmm5%2BqwKq6jKyrrqajYq61ecCfq56qXZqus8DHZqernZ2esrOxjLCgraBdma6ledKtnKmglaN6o63Lna6ipl2ltqTA1KucZmpgZoB0fJQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./167497-group-supportive-male-friends-host-nappy-shower-father-viral-tiktok-video-mzansi-loving-it.html><span>←</span><span>Group of Supportive Male Friends Host Nappy Shower for Father-To-Be in Viral TikTok Video, Mzansi Lo</span></a>
