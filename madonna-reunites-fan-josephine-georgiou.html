<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Madonna treats exposed Australian fan to Sydney concert</h1></header><section class=post-content><p id=esrq6XdQcQ2L data-wc=106>Last week <strong>Josephine Georgiou</strong> found herself at the <a class=hm-link href=#>centre of a media storm</a> when she was exposed on stage by <a class=hm-link href=#>Madonna</a>. To show there are no hard feeling, the 17-year-old accepted an offer from the pop star to attend a second Rebel Heart concert this week, and was seen cheering on her idol from the audience.Josephine and her mum Toni flew into Sydney on Sunday night, courtesy of Madonna, to watch the singer perform at the Allphones Arena. A spokesperson for Josephine told the Daily Mail Australia: “"Three days after the show, Madonna flew Josephine and her mother to Sydney for the final show of her Australian tour on Sunday night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f3616a30db36-josephine-a.jpg><p id=eoiLLQ429Mvt data-wc=11><strong>Josephine Georgiou shared a photo of herself outside the Sydney concert</strong></p><p id=eZ0R0rhLS8Pw data-wc=97>"Madonna dedicated the last thirty minutes of her show to Josephine including singing La Vie En Rose directly to her and giving her a bouquet of flowers. "During the concert, Madonna personally welcomed Josephine, who was positioned right next to the stage, walking over to her and saying: "Darling Josephine, you're back… so nice to see you." She went on to chat briefly to the teen and her mum before throwing her a bouquet of flowers.Josephine has previously spoken out about her headline-hitting encounter with Madonna in Brisbane, describing it as the "<strong>best moment of my life</strong>".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73c3f878f76e-josephine-2-a.jpg><p id=ezbcHkvuQa6H data-wc=17><strong>The 17-year-old later shared a picture of herself on the plane home, holding her bouquet from Madonna</strong></p><p id=eLDPWocKM9sF data-wc=90>"Only I get to decide if I'm humiliated or not. Why would people assume I am humiliated by my own breast, nipple or body?" the aspiring model said. "It's hilarious to me how much of a big deal it is to everyone. People just need to understand I was on stage in front of Madonna, I was looking her in the eyes and most people would just melt into a pool on stage, so it was only because I was standing in front of her that I looked so surprised."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQb2dsamJofXWCl2ikmpyfo7uiedGerKehpJrAbrLAp2Sjp6Oavam1zZ5koJ2fp7Squ9Ro</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laguna-beach-alum-morgan-smith-gives-birth-welcomes-baby-no-3.html><span>←</span><span>Laguna Beach Alum Morgan Smith Gives Birth, Welcomes Baby No. 3</span></a>
