Sarah Palin knows this all too well, as she claims this scenario happened in her split from Todd Palin. "I found out from an email from an attorney saying that she was hired and that was on June 19th, I'll never forget it," Sarah explained on the&nbsp;Dr. James Dobson's Family Talk<span class=S3Uucc>&nbsp;radio show in November 2019. "</span>Then on Todd's birthday, a week after our 31st anniversary is when he filed, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's not easy to talk about."&nbsp;</p><p>Ouch.&nbsp;If that's true, we have sympathy for Sarah — it's an awful way for a 31-year marriage to end.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarah, who referred to this split as "devastating," also revealed she and Todd are in counseling despite the supposed betrayal. "So it's not over, over," she explained, while also knocking the attorneys who are "getting rich" off of their breakup.</p><p>Although we support these two working things out if that's what they want, we can't help but think something is off here. What are we talking about, exactly?&nbsp;Well, Todd reportedly&nbsp;<a href=#>hired</a>&nbsp;the lawyer who represented his ex son-in-law, Dakota Meyer, in his&nbsp;<a href=#>divorce</a>&nbsp;from Bristol Palin. And speaking of Dakota, he fired off an odd message after Todd filed for divorce, sharing a cryptic quote about men protecting women. And lastly, Sarah's&nbsp;<a href=#>countersuit</a>&nbsp;claims she "does not agree with him on all issues in the divorce," which doesn't bode well for a reconciliation.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam5la4J0e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2stbp50pqpmqBdpa6ttc1moKxll5rBtbXNoGSdoaakv6Sxw2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neta-riskin.html><span>←</span><span>Shtisel Star Neta Riskin's Husband!
