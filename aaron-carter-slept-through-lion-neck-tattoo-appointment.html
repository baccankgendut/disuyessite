In a picture on her Instagram Story she shared afterward, he is shown with his eyes closed while she works away.

After all, he spent $5,000 just the week before on the massive Medusa/<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rhianna</strong></a> design he put on his face.</p><p>Tattoo artist Herchell L Carrasco told TMZ he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had to cut off</a> the pop artist, who kept wanting to add more. “[He] wanted to keep going and I had to stop him,” Carrasco told the publication. “I couldn’t cover his whole face in a tattoo. I just couldn’t.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Some have expressed concern over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carter’s mental health</a>. After opening up about his multiple diagnoses, which includes “multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia, acute anxiety and manic depression,” on The Doctors, his brother Nick Carter filed a restraining order against him. He claimed that Aaron made comments about wanting to harm his wife and unborn child. However, Aaron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied these claims</a>.</p><p>However, both tattoo artists assured TMZ that the “I’m All About You” singer seemed steady.</p><p>“Before I tattoo anyone, I take into consideration their mental state,” Carrasco said. “In Aaron’s case, I assessed the situation and I genuinely felt he was in a good place mentally to get tattooed.” Katherine also said he seemed “coherent.” And if he napped, clearly comfortable too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5aus7vNZpqaqqSav26%2Fy56nrWWknb%2BwwcahZKWhn6N6r7HCpGStmaSpvLB5wKmnqKGeqbqmutNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-who-maureen-wener-authorities-identify-bicyclist-killed-highland-park-hit-and-run-incident.html><span>←</span><span>Who was Maureen Wener?
