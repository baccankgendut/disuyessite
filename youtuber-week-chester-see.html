Cover of Adele’s “Set Fire to the Rain”</strong></h3><p>Although it is not Chester’s most popular cover, with 3.4 million views, his rendition of Adele’s “Set Fire to the Rain” is one of his best. It also stars D-Trix dancing along.</p><p></p><h3><strong>4. Original Song: “God Damn You’re Beautiful”</strong></h3><p>“God Damn You’re Beautiful” has over 11 million views. As a result, that makes it the most popular of Chester’s original songs. It is also one of the first original songs he released.</p><p></p><h3><strong>5. Original Song: “Whistle While I Work it”</strong></h3><p>This is a fun video starring fellow YouTuber Toby Tuner. It also stars actor/comedian Wayne Brady.
