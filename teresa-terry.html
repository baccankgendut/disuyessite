However, the main thing about Teresa Terry is that she is&nbsp; Todd Chrisley’s ex-wife. Although Teresa Terry’s ex-husband Todd is a television personality best known for hosting trendy TV shows like “Chrisley Knows Best” and “Theo Chrisley,” little or nothing is known about Teresa’s career.</p><p>It seems her ex-husband’s popularity and popularity have eclipsed it. She is never open to discussing her professional life or career. Teresa may have something for her to do about a job or something that interests her, but her lack of seriousness makes it more difficult to find information about her.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=relationship-status><span id=Relationship_Status><strong>Relationship Status</strong></span></h3><p>Teresa Terry Chrisley is married to Todd Chrisley.

After 15 months of giving birth to their first child, the couple again had another child named Kyle Chrisley.</p><p>Sadly, Teresa and Todd’s married life could not be successful. After a few years of living together, they divorced. Todd abused Teresa physically and mentally. After Todd tried to kill Teresa with a knife, she considered ending the marriage.</p><p>They completed their divorce proceedings in 1996 and began to share custody of their children.
