I’m surprised that Kristen gave birth already, as it seems like she’s only been pregnant for a short while. That’s to her credit since she didn’t announce the pregnancy until she was several months along. The happy couple made the announcement on Twitter in their typically tongue-in-cheek way, which is way better than the “over the moon” statements we’ve come to expect.</p><p>It’s a girl for Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell!</p><p>“Lincoln Bell Shepard is here,” the Parenthood star Tweets. “She has mom’s beauty and dad’s obsession with breasts. Hooray!!!”</p><p>“My new roommate poops her pants and doesn’t pay rent…basically Dax pre-sobriety,” Bell adds. “Welcome baby Lincoln.”</p><p>Shepard, 38, and the House of Lies star, 32, announced the pregnancy in November.</p><p>Earlier this winter, Bell celebrated her baby shower while Shepard joked that he hoped their baby resembled his fiancée.</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>I’ve never heard of Lincoln as a girl’s name. Just a couple of days ago my son was playing with a three year-old boy named Lincoln, and I remembered the kid’s name because I have a close friend with a son named Lincoln. I’m used to hearing that name for boys, and it just seems weird that it’s being used as a girl’s name. Kaiser and I were emailing about this and she mentioned that “Clinton” isn’t a common name yet, while I was surprised that “Reagan” is so common a name for girls. It just seems like “Reagan” should be a boys name, but somehow it got associated with girls.</p><p>Maybe that’s what Kristen Bell was thinking – she should reclaim the name “Lincoln” for girls/women. You know, she probably just started a trend. She’s famous and adorable, I can see the name shooting up in popularity for little girls.</p><p>Remember when Kristen was so over-the-top and sobbing on Ellen when she was confronted with a sloth? How much of a mess must she be now that she’s got her own baby? She must be so obsessed with little Lincoln, but she’s trying to play it off like they got a roommate. Congratulations to Kristen and Dax!</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wenn20060177-724x1024.jpg alt title=wenn20060177 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wenn20059438-761x1024.jpg alt title=wenn20059438 width="500 class=" alignnone size-large wp-image-288997 sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wenn4040305-682x1024.jpg alt title=wenn4040305 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photo credit: WENN.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3Bobn51e8qroKyslaOso7HLpZadmaiUwKmxz6GYq5yPrLKtr86mnJickaq0qcDEq5aloZ6YvK26vq2fmqyjlK6gs8iro6yXnpa6pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kinyumba-mutakabbir.html><span>←</span><span>Kinyumba Mutakabbir</span></a>
