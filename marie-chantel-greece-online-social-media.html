She is by far the most prominent at posting personal photographs. <strong>Marie-Chantal's</strong> online account tells of the fun she enjoys with husband <strong>Prince Pavlos</strong> and their five children: Maria Olympia, 16, Konstantinos Alexios, 14, Achilleas Andreas 12, Odysseas Kimon, 8 and four-year-old Aristides Stavros. Aristides features in a large number of the images, often posing with the family's pets or sporting outfits from his mother's clothing label. And to prove they are like any family, <strong>Marie-Chantal</strong> has even&nbsp;posted a photo of the youngster throwing a tantrum to avoid going to school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c869693a044d-marie-2-z.jpg><p id=eP75SYCDVUJf data-wc=116>Other events documented by the <strong>44-year-old</strong> include skiing holidays, birthdays, national holidays and even a trip to the Olympic Games last summer. During England's recent snowy weather <strong>Marie-Chantal</strong> couldn't resist taking a snapshot of her garden, transformed into a winter wonderland, as well as photo of young Aristides with a snowball. And she may be a princess but <strong>Marie-Chantal's</strong> photos also prove her sense of humour. In one picture she she can be seen poking her tongue out whilst holding a huge bottle of spicy condiment - Tabasco sauce. In another image the <strong>princess</strong> is seen wearign an&nbsp;unflattering pair of glasses and holding a kitchen knife and an onion, with the caption "my onion glasses..."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/67e7824b5110-marie-3-z.jpg><p id=eyWax2ik72ZX data-wc=186>Family is very important to <strong>Marie-Chantal</strong> who has two sisters: Pia-Christina and Alexandra-Natasha. Pia-Christina was married to Christopher Getty, whose family who made their name in oil, whilst Alexandra-Natasha married <strong>Prince Alexander von Furstenberg</strong> in 1995<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Although sadly both sisters are now divorced.The trio, who are sometimes known as the Miller sisters, were raised across Hong Kong, Switzerland, Paris and New York.When she's not spending time on the social site <strong>Marie-Chantal </strong>can also be found at work. The <strong>princess</strong> designs her own range of luxury children's clothing and accessories for a company which&nbsp;bears her name. Businesswoman <strong>Marie-Chantal</strong> founded the brand in 2000, the year her third child was born.

A week before they attended Marie-Chantal and Pavlos' nuptials, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh hosted a tea party for the couple at Claridge's hotel in Mayfair.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
