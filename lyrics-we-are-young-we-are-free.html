Supergrass - Alright Lyrics
But we are young, we get by Can't go mad, ain't got time Sleep around, if we like, But we're alright, Got some cash, bought some wheels, Took it out, 'cross the fields, Lost control, hit a wall, But we're alright, Are we like you, I can't be sure, Of the scene, as she turns, We are strange in our worlds, But we are young, we run green, The Moffatts - We Are Young Lyrics"><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
