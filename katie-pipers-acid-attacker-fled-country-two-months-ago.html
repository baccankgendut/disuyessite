He cannot be considered for release until 2025.</p><p>Lynch and Ms Piper had dated briefly before the steroid-fuelled martial arts fan, who had a previous conviction for pouring boiling water over a man, became obsessively jealous.</p><p>In court, Lynch and Sylvestre were told by Judge Nicholas Browne QC they were "the face of pure evil".</p><p>In a victim impact statement to the court, Ms Piper wrote: "When the acid was thrown at me, it felt like I was burning in hell. It was an indescribable, unique, torturous pain.</p><p>"I have lost my future, my career, my spirit, my body, my looks, my dignity… the list goes on. All I am left with is an empty shell. A part of me has died that will never come back. This is worse than death."</p><p>Sylvestre became eligible for parole in 2015 but his application was blocked after he was deemed unfit for release.</p><p>Another application in 2018 was successful and he was freed.</p><p>At the time Ms Piper had tweeted: "This is a really difficult time for me.</p><p>"I am trying to come to terms with the decision and this is something I need to deal with.</p><p>"Over the past two weeks Strictly (Come Dancing) has already given me such a welcome and positive distraction from my past.</p><p>"Whilst there is never a good time to hear this news, I am glad I have this new journey to concentrate on. Thank you for your continued support. Love Katie."</p><p>In 2019, Sylvestre was recalled to jail for an unrelated incident.</p><p>Sylvestre was granted parole again in 2020 and was released after errors in his prosecution emerged.</p><p>It is not clear why Sylvestre has again been recalled to prison.</p><p>Offenders who are released from jail are subject to strict licence conditions, which can include exclusion zones. Failure to comply can result in an immediate recall to prison.</p><p>Piper, 38, who now works as a TV presenter, was awarded an OBE in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.</p><p>She is best known for sharing her story about surviving the attack in the documentary Katie: My Beautiful Face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9raWhpYGR%2BcXvKmquinV2ltrGx0axkmpuZmXqiwNOamqSdomKzrbHDZpqorZ6pv7p507CmZqWfo8Gpv4yanqhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karl-lagerfeld-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Karl Lagerfeld Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
