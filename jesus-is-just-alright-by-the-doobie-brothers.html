Rather as portrayed, the singer has a sort of a personal relationship with Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p>And the emphasis isn’t really on his belief in Jesus but more so him deeming the son of God, as he is also known, quite the cool fellow, regardless of how others may feel about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jesus-Is-Just-Alright-by-The-Doobie-Brothers-Lyrics.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who wrote “Jesus Is Just Alright”?</h3><p>This song was written by a gospel musician named Art Reynolds.&nbsp;Furthermore, it was his band, a group known as The Art Reynolds Singers, who first dropped a rendition of&nbsp;“Jesus Is Just Alright”&nbsp;in 1966.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the years a number of prominent acts have put their talents to it, including The Doobie Brothers, who aren’t gospel artists themselves.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Doobie Brothers</h3><p>The Doobie Brothers are still technically extant as of this writing, though their heyday was back during the band’s inaugural decade of the 1970s.&nbsp;</p><p>This track can be found on one of their projects from that era, the group’s second album&nbsp;“Toulouse Street”, which came out through Warner Records on 1 July 1972.&nbsp;The members who are noted as having participated on this recording are:</p><ul><li>frontman, Patrick Simmons<strong></strong></li><li>guitarist, Tom Johnston</li><li>bassist, Tiran Porter</li><li>drummer Little John Hartman (1950-2022) <strong></strong></li><li>drummer, Michael Hossack (1946-2012)<strong></strong></li></ul><p>Johnston&nbsp;has pointed out&nbsp;that even though The Doobie Brothers did drop this song, they are far from a religious act.&nbsp;However, their fans that were of Christian inclinations definitely got a kick out of their live performances of&nbsp;“Jesus Is Just Alright”.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Achievements of “Jesus Is Just Alright”</h3><p>This song acted as the second single from&nbsp;“Toulouse Street”, and it peaked at 35th&nbsp;place on the US Hot 100. This achievement made The Doobie Brothers’ cover&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-successful version</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;“Jesus Is Just Alright”&nbsp;to date.&nbsp;</p><p>Also to note, their single version is shorter than the one featured on the album.&nbsp;And this is also considered to be one of the band’s most-notable hits, in that it went on to be&nbsp;appear on a number&nbsp;of their compilation and live albums afterwards.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })(); <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Jesus-Is-Just-Alright-by-The-Doobie-Brothers.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Noteworthy Stuff</h3><p>The Doobie Brothers were inspired to cover this song specifically by the version that The Byrds put out in 1969.</p><p>Ted Templeman, a regular Doobie Brothers’ collaborator, produced their rendition of&nbsp;“Jesus Is Just Alright”.</p><p>Other notable covers of “Jesus Is Just Alright” include the below:</p><ul><li>American rock band&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Exile</a>&nbsp;in 1973 for their eponymous debut album.</li><li>American Christian rock and hip hop group&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC Talk</a>&nbsp;in 1992 for their third album, “Free at Last”.</li><li>In 2006,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Randolph & the Family band</a>&nbsp;featured Eric Clapton for their version.

The episode was aired on 27th&nbsp;April, 1997.</p><p>2012 American comedy movie “Wanderlust” starring Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd also used this song.</p><p>American crime drama “City on a Hill” used “Jesus Is Just Alright” on season 2, episode 1. The episode was aired on 28th&nbsp;March, 2021.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Words from Fans</h3><p>As expected, this is a song that resonates with Christian fans who wholeheartedly believe that Jesus Christ is their Lord and Savior.</p><p>A fan shared his story of losing his dad and hearing him singing “Jesus Is Just Alright” before he passed. The song has since brought comfort to him since he believes his father is currently in heaven with Jesus.</p><p>A hardcore Doobie Brothers’ fan told us this song gave her the hope she needed to survive during a very dark and hopeless chapter in her life.</p><p>Another fan, who lost his uncle recently, wrote that this was uncle’s favorite song. So he listens to the song a few times a day in memory of him. According to him, he feels it’s his uncle’s way of telling him he’s in a good place.</p><p>Many fans of this song have also confessed that the track was responsible for making them believers in Jesus Christ. One fan (who converted via this song) said the chaos that characterized his previous life has now been replaced with peace and bliss since he started following the footsteps of Jesus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZqOdo6rAbrXSZqGuq6Rirq2%2ByKCfrWWSrnq1tMRmm6inkp6ybq7RqKuhnaKofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./its-a-little-funny-start-of-elton-johns-your-song-html.html><span>←</span><span>It's a little ___ funny ...
