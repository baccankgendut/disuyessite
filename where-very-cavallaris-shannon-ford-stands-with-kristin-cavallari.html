And I was like, ‘No, I’m out of office at the time. Sorry.'”</p><p>The model was let go as the social media director of Uncommon James during the season 2 premiere of the reality series. She claimed, however, that she was supposed to stay on the show after being fired from <a href=#>Cavallari’s company</a>.</p><p>“It extended past just being fired from the job. It got kinda personal,” Ford said, alleging that the <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a> alum’s issues with her resulted in her termination from the E! series. “That’s what happens when you’re in charge.”</p><p>The Gilbert, South Carolina, native admitted that she “would” return to reality TV if the circumstances were right, saying, “I loved it. I even loved being mic’d up. I thrived. It was cool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Very-Cavallari-Shannon-Ford-Shares-Where-Kristin-Cavallari-Stand-After-Firing.jpg><p>Ford has not kept in touch with her former boss, but <a href=#>she did make headlines in November 2020</a> when she dined with <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a>, seven months after <a href=#>he split from the Hills alum</a>, 34.</p><p>The pair were out in Charleston, South Carolina, with their mutual friend <strong>Mark “Chuy” Block</strong> when Cutler, 37, accidentally took a video of Ford, which he later uploaded.</p><p>“I wanted to be, like, the cool girl that was genuinely just like enjoying a drink with her friend and, like, Jay,” Ford said on a January 2021 episode of <a href=#>Dear Media’s “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast</a>. “So, I was like, I’m not going to make this weird at all.”</p><p>When asked on Thursday whether she is friends Cavallari at all these days, Ford said, “Certainly not.”</p><p>She also weighed in on the designer’s split from the former NFL quarterback, revealing that people in Nashville “knew it was coming,” noting that it is a “small town.”</p><p>Cavallari and Cutler, who <a href=#>share sons Camden, 8, and Jaxon, 6, and daughter Saylor, 5</a>, announced their separation in April 2020 after seven years of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Very-Cavallari-Shannon-Ford-Shares-Where-Kristin-Cavallari-Stand-After-Firing-Jay-Cutler.jpg><p>“I wasn’t shocked when I saw, like, the headlines,” Ford said on Thursday. “I mean, I didn’t really think that they were a bad couple at all together. I thought they seemed happy. But as far as the headlines, I think everyone in our town had kind of known it was coming for a few months.”</p><p>She added: “I don’t ever want to see anyone get divorced that are just, like, people that drifted apart. That’s sad.”</p><p>After being spotted with Ford, <a href=#>the former athlete</a> made headlines for his relationship with <a href=#>Southern Charm</a> star <a href=#><strong>Madison LeCroy</strong></a> in January 2021.</p><p>Last month, LeCroy, 33, slammed Cavallari’s parenting skills after the cookbook author hung out with her ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Austen Kroll</strong></a> in December 2020, by <a href=#>mocking the pair’s wine-filled night</a> of dancing in Nashville.</p><p>Cutler and Cavallari <a href=#>put on a united front</a> after LeCroy’s Instagram Live video broke, which led to the Greenville, South Carolina native coming for Cutler.</p><p>LeCroy released <a href=#>alleged messages she exchanged</a> with the former Chicago Bears player, claiming he pursued her. A source told Us Weekly at the time that the <a href=#>hairstylist’s actions were “just noise” for Cavallari</a>, adding that she is “unbothered by what is being said about her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>True Comfort author</a>, for her part, has been romantically <a href=#>linked to comedian <strong>Jeff Dye</strong></a> since October 2020 when they were spotted packing on the PDA in Chicago.</p><p><strong>Listen to Us editors break down Khloe Kardashian’s Photoshop nightmare in under 3 minutes!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJWnsm7CxKuwZpuRq66tuMCroKxlo52ur7rOp2Sfp6KZerTAwKebrGWnnsGpecqroKysmaN6pK3VmqOlmaKefA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./myq-kaplan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Myq Kaplan Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a>
