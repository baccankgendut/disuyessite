It is with a great deal of sadness that we share the heartbreaking news of his passing. His cherished daughters Alexis, Brooke, Cassie, and Dallas, as well as their newest member, baby Emery, are among those he leaves behind.</p><p>Carlos was more than just a father; he was a rock of unflinching support for his daughters as they pursued their softball careers. His dedication knew no bounds, whether it was in the form of tirelessly driving them to various parks for practices or ferrying them between fields while games were in progress. Every waking moment of his life was devoted to making sure that his daughters were successful on the softball fields.</p><p>During this extremely difficult time, we want his grieving wife Casandra and the rest of the Visaya family to know that our thoughts and prayers are with these individuals. Not only will the absence of Carlos be keenly felt within his immediate family circle, but it will also be felt deeply within our larger community.</p><p>For a considerable amount of time, the Visaya family has been an indispensable component of our Downey Ponytail family life. It is absolutely necessary for us as a community to come together and offer our assistance to them during this difficult time. We have begun a meal train in order to provide sustenance and comfort to those who are going through this difficult time. You can contribute and offer support by clicking on the link that is located in our bio.</p><p>In addition, making preparations for a GoFundMe campaign to provide additional assistance to the Visaya family is currently in progress. We will soon be sharing the specifics of this matter. The legacy that Carlos left behind as a devoted father and a treasured member of our softball community will live on in our hearts forever. Let us pay tribute to his memory by banding together and providing his family with unwavering support as they go through this trying time. We have the ability to offer consolation and assistance to the Visaya family in their journey toward recovery through our collective strength and solidarity. üôèüèå</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5OWv6270matoquRrq5uu8Giq66Zoq56pK3RpaasZaaewKLFwGafmqtdpa60v8SdZJqvka56pbHArZ9mrJiaeri70aWbZqeSnsG0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bailey-payne.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Bailey Payne Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
