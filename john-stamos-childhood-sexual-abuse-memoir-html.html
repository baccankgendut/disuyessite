In his new memoir, If You Would Have Told Me, and as reported by <a href=#>People</a>, Stamos discloses being abused by. a babysitter. He says it took writing a book for him to truly acknowledge the memories. “I mean, I knew, it was always in the back, and I do so much advocacy,” he says. “I felt like, I remembered it slightly. It has always been there, but I packed it away as people do, right?” Stamos told People that he first attempted to deal with those memories when accepting an award relating to his advocacy work with abused children. Writing his acceptance speech made him see what he had in common with the kids he worked with. “And then I thought, ‘No, tonight is not about me. It’s about the kids. I’m going to pack it away again until the right moment,’” he said. “Otherwise, I’m a phony fuck.” If You Would Have Told Me comes out October 24.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>People</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cj1d41noe00xtqayeosu73j0y@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>John Stamos and Bob Saget Lovingly Recall Being Slapped by Don Rickles</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>John Stamos Discloses Childhood Sexual Abuse in New Memoir</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXyru8enZKyskaK8tHnCoaClnJikvKV50p6vrpmcYq6jwdKeZKadnaS2s3rHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-clarkson-daughter-emily-addresses-comments.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Clarkson's daughter Emily breaks silence after dad's Meghan Markle comments</span></a>
