Kelly Dooley is originally from California and earned her Masters in Media, Culture, and Communications from New York University. She began designing a line of sportswear called, Bodyrock Sport, in 2009. The line of functional, fashionable clothing was developed based on her frustration with finding quality sportswear that also looked trendy. Though her sportswear and sports bras have become known for the amount of "bling" that is often attached to them, they have also earned a reputation for being comfortable. Her line of bras got a boost, when her "Eternal Love Bra", a diamond encrusted sports bra with 18K gold zippers and snaps, was worn by <a href=# title="Britney Spears Net Worth">Britney Spears</a> and her dance double in all of the "Twister Dance" advertisements. In addition to her work as a designer, her search for a wedding dress was chronicled on TLC's "Say Yes to the Dress", and a spin-off one-hour special was also aired, called "Say Yes to the Dress: The Big Day".</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356119 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kelly-Dooley.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1256px) 100vw, 1256px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356119 class=wp-caption-text>Kelly Dooley (Photo by Fairchild Archive/Penske Media via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqlsdKinqedoqh8rLHLpbBmnJ%2BkuabFjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-jeffre.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Justin Jeffre Age, Dating, Girlfriend, Affairs &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
