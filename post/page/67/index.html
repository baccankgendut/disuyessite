<a href=../../../do-you-need-underlayment-for-smartcore-ultra-html.html></a>
Answer
The smartcore does not include an underlayment that is connected to it. In terms of sound absorption, the floor will be somewhat quieter than sheet vinyl, but it will not be noticeably quieter than conventional laminate. In most contemporary condominium buildings (e.g., high-rise structures), regular laminate needs an acoustic underlay.
Is it necessary to use underlayment with Smartcore ultra in this case? The smartcore does not include an underlayment that is connected to it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Drew Barrymore Goes Without Makeup on 40th Birthday at the Beach: Pic</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>
