<a href=../../../lotus-flower.html></a>
Thom said, the first time he played this song, that he wrote it whilst on holiday for his daughter. Therefore, it is my take that the song is more about a parent's struggle to come to terms with the fact that a child must grow to develop fully. Thom has written two songs clearly about Noah: Sail you to the Moon, and Fog. So my theory is quite plausible.

For the sixth year in a row, businessman Kiyoshi Kimura left the annual New Year's fish auction at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo with the biggest fish of the bunch. Kimura shelled out 74.2 million yen for the giant 466-pound Pacific bluefin tuna, which comes to about $632,000 in American dollars.
