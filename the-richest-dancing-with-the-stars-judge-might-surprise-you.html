However, most fans will recognize him from "Dancing with the Stars" as he's judged every season since its launch in 2005 — that's over 440 episodes, per <a href=#>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Even more impressive is that he simultaneously judged Britain's version of the show, "Strictly Come Dancing," from its 2004 debut through 2020. According to <a href=#>Hello!</a>, the latter earned him between £200,000 and £249,000 (between $277,000 and $345,000) in 2018 and, even though he took a 50% pay cut in 2020 because he couldn't appear in-person, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> calculated&nbsp;that he earned £125,000 (about $173,000) for 3 minutes and 46 seconds of screen time. That comes out to a whopping £33,185 (or $46,000) per minute. It's no wonder he was "gutted" to be replaced in 2021 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions (via <a href=#>Chronicle Live</a>). He's not short on cash, though, as he continues to earn an estimated <a href=#>$30,000 per episode</a> for the U.S. show.</p><p dir=ltr>And while Tonioli has splurged on real estate, <a href=#>buying a $2.825 million mansion</a> in West Hollywood, he's all about saving. Speaking with <a href=#>This Is Money</a>, he shared how his parents "instilled in me a great respect for money, because it was always very scarce, and you had to manage it correctly." That good management resulted in a $16 million net worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb2lkZ4Jxe9OhnGaqmZi1pr%2FTZpuappOeu6h51qKroWWknbJuv9OaqaxlmqqxqLGMpqCgoKRiwLa%2Bz6ugrJ1drry2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terrence-o-hara.html><span>←</span><span>Terrence O'Hara Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
