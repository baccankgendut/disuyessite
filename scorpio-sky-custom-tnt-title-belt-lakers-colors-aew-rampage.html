The antics in Florida enraged Sky, Page, and Lambert, who finally relented and decided to accept Guevara's Double Or Nothing challenge. After the segment, the match was made official: Men of the Year & Paige Van Zant will compete against Kazarian, Guevara, and Conti in mixed trios action. If Guevara’s team loses, neither Guevara nor Kazarian will be allowed to challenge for the TNT Championship ever again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sky won the TNT Championship from Guevara on the April 27 edition of AEW Dynamite. <a href=#>Guevara won the championship</a> from Sky just 11 days prior to losing it, making him a two-time champ. <a href=#>Guevara became TNT Champion</a> for the first time when he ended the 141-day reign of "God's Favorite Champion" Miro in the main event of the <a href=#>September 29 edition of AEW Dynamite</a>.
