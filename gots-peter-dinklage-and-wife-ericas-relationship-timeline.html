We were all at a friend’s house and someone said, ‘They’re walking the elephants through the Queens-Midtown Tunnel,’” Dinklage recalled in a 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a>. “The circus was in town and it was snowing, and they were walking the elephants through Manhattan, a long line of them. It was like something out of a beautiful, fantastical, end-of-the-world, crazy, romantic movie. … So that’s the night we met, the night the elephants walked through Manhattan.”</p><p>The couple tied the knot in 2005 and welcomed a daughter in 2011 and a <a href=#>second child</a> in 2017.</p><p>The power couple have been going strong since then — and have even worked on multiple projects together, including the musical Cyrano which was later adapted into a film in 2022. While Schmidt wrote the musical, Dinklage took on the titular role — which he later admitted to begging his wife for.</p><p>“Begged? Yeah. I mean, essentially, yes, that’s true,” he shared in a 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS News</a>. “For an actor, you always wanna do something that — for me at least — that scares you … I just never had sung since I was a kid.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Dinklage and Schmidt’s relationship:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Game-of-Thrones-Peter-Dinklage-and-Wife-Erica-Schmidts-Relationship-Timeline1.jpg><h3>Their First Meeting</h3><p>Dinklage and Schmidt first met at a mutual friends’ house in New York City in the early 2000s, which Dinklage described to be something out of a “crazy, romantic movie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Game-of-Thrones-Peter-Dinklage-and-Wife-Erica-Schmidts-Relationship-Timeline22.jpg><h3>Their Elopement</h3><p>Instead of a traditional wedding, the duo decided to go to Vegas and tie the knot in 2005.</p><p>“I was going there for a charity event and then while we were there, we just decided to do it,” Dinklage shared in a 2016 interview with The New York Times. “It was a bit lonely. We got a VHS videocassette of the wedding that no one will ever see, that we’ve buried in a box deep beneath the earth’s core.”</p><h3>Welcoming Their Children</h3><p>Schmidt welcomed her and Dinklage’s first child together, a baby girl, in 2011, however, they have yet to reveal her name or exact date of birth.</p><p>At the 2012 Golden Globes, Dinklage shared with Access Hollywood that fatherhood was “incredible” and “life changing.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In 2017, Us Weekly confirmed that the pair had welcomed their second child together.</p><h3>Dinklage On Schmidt’s Talents</h3><p>In 2015, Dinklage gushed about how “brilliant” his wife is. “She loves theater. Unlike a lot of other people in our profession where film is the ultimate goal, theater is sacred to her. It’s not entertainment; it’s art,” he told The Guardian at the time. “She’s very inspiring. She’s definitely the artist of the family … I am just the TV actor who pays the bills.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagp6SoerGx056pZpyZo7itrcaeZJqmlGLEqrLEZpyroZOWwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fifty-shades-of-grey-rating-film-is-r-rated-for-strong-sexual-content-201581.html><span>←</span><span>Fifty Shades of Grey Rating: Film Is R-Rated for Strong Sexual Content</span></a>
