Past live-action villains, Alfred Molina’s Doctor Octopus, Electro and the Green Goblin, made a brief appearance in the teaser, and the latter antagonist is thought to be <a href=#>the return of Willem Dafoe</a>.</strong></p><p>Other returning characters include Zendaya’s MJ, Jacob Batalon’s Ned, Marisa Tomei’s May Parker, Jon Favreau’s Happy, and other supporting characters to cushion Tom Holland’s epic union with Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange. Fans have also spotted an impressive detail that shows Angourie Rice’s return as Betty Brant.</p><h3 id=h-betty-brant-s-trailer-appearance>Betty Brant’s Trailer Appearance</h3><ul><li>In a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it scene near the beginning of the trailer, Holland’s Peter Parker can be seen walking through the halls of&nbsp; Midtown School of Science and Technology, with other students hounding the recently exposed Spider-Man by taking pictures of him. In the right-hand corner of the scene, you can see a reporter on the television and the name of the reporter clearly reads Betty Brant.</li></ul><p>Actor Rice previously confirmed that her character would return for No Way Home and her position as a Midtown News anchor has led her to broadcast coverage of Parker’s Spider-Man reveal to the entire school.</p><p>Courtesy of the Marvel community on Twitter, one account conveniently enlarged the still to confirm it was indeed Brant’s name on the screen. However, you would be forgiven for missing this detail during your first viewing of the trailer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h3 id=h-is-matt-murdock-in-the-no-way-home-trailer>Is Matt Murdock in the No Way Home Trailer?</h3><ul><li>Possibly. Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock has not been confirmed for No Way Home. However, Marvel fans are adamant that the lawyer makes an appearance within the trailer.</li></ul><p>There is a scene within the teaser that shows Parker being interrogated by a member of the Department of Damage Control, followed by a character slamming a bulky folder down on the table. Nearly every fan is convinced that this is Murdock, with some even identifying him by his arm hair. If you look closely, you can also see the tip of his stubbly chin.</p><p>Mysterio’s reveal that Parker is Spider-Man has caused one hell of a fallout, according to the teaser, and the No Way Home plot has always suggested that Parker would require some sort of legal representation to navigate the backlash. Therefore, the white-shirt character could indeed be Murdock on hand to help.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full">Marvel Studios</figure><p>Spider-Man: No Way Home will release in theaters on December 17th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pcHApaqhp5OgsrO%2FjZympmejpbalsdFmpJqmXaO8bsPAsmShp52aerW%2BwKKjnqpdlruou9SroJ5lop6wpr%2BMm5ytrKlir7Otza1kppmbmsBurYyrnK2toqN8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anaiya-bains-missing.html><span>←</span><span>Anaiya Bains Missing: Vancouver Police Launch Search for 13-Year-Old Girl</span></a>
