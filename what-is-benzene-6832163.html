Elevated levels of the known carcinogen have popped up in products ranging from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dry shampoos</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>sunscreen</a>. The latest occurrence is in acne products containing benzoyl peroxide. The compound wasn't intentionally added to these products —&nbsp;it appeared as a byproduct during production or degradation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While benzene is not intentionally being added to skin-care products, it can end up in them in the form of a contaminant or as in the case of benzoyl peroxide, as a result of the breakdown of the ingredient," says dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick. "While we haven’t seen benzene connected to benzoyl peroxide in the past, there have been prior concerns with benzene when it was found as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>contaminant in certain sunscreens</a> through testing performed by the same lab."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marisa Garshick, MD</a> is a board-certified dermatologist in New York City and New Jersey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Benzene is a compound that is known to be a carcinogen," says Dr. Garshick. "It is used as a solvent and can be found in gasoline and is a natural component of crude oil."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inhalation accounts for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>95 to 99 percent of benzene exposure</a>. According to the American Cancer Society, rates of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been found higher in those who work in industries chemical, shoemaking, and oil refining where they are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>exposed to high levels of benzene</a>. Some studies have also suggested a link to other forms of leukemia and blood-related cancers, but the evidence is not as strong as that for AML.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lab studies in animals like rats and mice have shown that benzene can cause different types of tumors when inhaled or swallowed. It can also cause chromosome changes in bone marrow cells in the lab —&nbsp;a change that is often seen in human leukemia cells. Evidence linking benzene to other forms of cancers is scant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many of the past benzene scares were linked to aerosol products, where benzene was found in the propellant that allows the product to be sprayed on. In the case of acne products, benzene was created by the degradation of benzoyl peroxide (the main ingredient in these products) when the samples were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>incubated at extreme temperatures</a> by researchers at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Valisure</a>, a third-party testing agency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Valisue is also behind many of the other benzene-in-beauty product studies. "It is important to note that these findings were released from an independent laboratory and the methods used still need to be further investigated and validated," says Dr. Garshick. "Overall, more data is needed to verify how to translate these findings into real life."<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-benzene-used-for></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Benzene Used For?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Benzene has many industrial uses, including the production of chemicals used to make plastics, resins, nylons, detergents, and drugs. It's also part of gasoline.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benzene-in-acne-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benzene in Acne Products</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Valisure discovered elevated levels of benzene in benzoyl peroxide products from brands like CeraVe, Clinique, La Roche-Posay, and Proactiv. These levels were discovered after the products were incubated at 122<strong>°</strong>F for 18 days. Valisure detected over 10 parts per million (ppm) of benzene in 42 products, over 100 ppm in 17 products, and over 1,500 ppm of benzene produced in two products. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that humans be exposed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>no more than 2 pmm of benzene per day</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While it is difficult to interpret these findings and how they would apply to real-world scenarios, it is important to remember that some people may keep their benzoyl peroxide products in the bathroom, in their gym bag outside, or in the car, where even though the temperatures may not reach 100<strong>°</strong>F, temperatures may be higher and potentially contribute to some product breakdown," says Dr. Garshick. Products may also be exposed to extreme temperatures during transport on hot days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, it is still unknown how much topical benzene exposure can cause. "More information would be needed to better understand how much benzene gets absorbed by the skin and how this impacts overall health," says Dr. Garshick.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benzene-in-spray-on-products></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benzene in Spray-On Products</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Valisure has found benzene in products like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>sunscreens</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>dry shampoos</a>, leading to recalls from brands like Johnson & Johnson&nbsp;and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Proctor & Gamble</a>. Following a 2021 J&J recall, a team of dermatologists examined data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 2003 to 2006 and 2009 to 2018 and&nbsp;found that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>sunscreen use is not associated with increased blood concentrations</a> of benzene among adults in the United States.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-forms-of-benzene-exposure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Forms of Benzene Exposure</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most benzene exposure <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>comes from the world around us</a>. "Exposures can occur in the environment as a result of forest fires, volcanoes, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle exhaust," says Dr. Garshick. Low levels of benzene also occur in contaminated drinking water and some foods.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-so-what-should-i-do-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>So, What Should I Do Now?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have been using any products found to contain benzene, there's no need to panic.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is normal to feel concerned about these findings," says Dr. Garshick. "And while there is no formal statement by the FDA at this time, it is reasonable to hold off on the use of products listed until we have more information. It also is reasonable, until we get more information, to store your benzoyl products in cool temperatures and avoid excessive heat exposure. That said, it is also important to remember that benzene is present in our natural environment and while additional exposure should be avoided, it is important to remember that we are already getting exposed to benzene."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571qGYrWWZqHqjsc2znKedXWuFdH6Qb2o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abby-brammell-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Abby Brammell Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a>
