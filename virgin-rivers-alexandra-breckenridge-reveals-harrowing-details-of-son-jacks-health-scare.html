In that moment, it was all just very real to me."</p><p id=e8dgjnqG1Oi data-wc=61>Alexandra and Casey met at a party in 2012 and tied the knot three years later in an intimate and beautiful ceremony in Colorado. The family of four has enjoyed happier times recently; due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes, which came to an end earlier this month, the 41-year-old has been <a class=hm-link href=#>spending plenty of time at the family home</a> in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd0ed8cd58ae-alexandra-breckenridge-and-husband.jpg><p id=eUAsdyt7_ww data-wc=52>She said on Instagram previously: "I feel like I've been cooking since I got back from dropping off my daughter at school, I'm trying to do something fun and creative with my time because SAG is on strike and I can't go back to work and I can't even talk about work.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e7HAASEgHVm data-wc=24>"So, if all y'all are trying to send me messages asking about work-related things, I can't answer you and I'm really sorry about that."</p><p id=eHct16gnZDM data-wc=56>Back in 2017, she told US Weekly how despite her successful acting career, family comes first. <strong>"When you have children.
