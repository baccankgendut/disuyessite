He has not made a big secret out of the fact that he wants another chance with her, he is not over her. Khloe’s continually shot him down but Tristan’s persistent. He deeply regrets losing Khloe and he is very open about it, he does not seem ready to give up.’</p><p>Aside from Khloe’s fans who have undoubtedly rolled their eyes completely into their skulls at his flirty attempts, Wendy Williams also called him out by telling Tristan on her talk show to ‘Leave [Khloe] alone! She’s obviously done with you.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, as another source went on to dish, ‘Tristan has no plans on stopping his efforts to win back Khloe anytime soon and he doubts he ever will. Tristan’s not concerned whatsoever with what Wendy Williams, or anybody besides Khloe, thinks about his efforts. This is between him and Khloe only. Tristan thinks about Khloe all the time and feels like he made the biggest mistake of his life for what he did to her.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebqsSsecuoqqKml2K4qbjOnmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZqGjYsGztdKtmKdlpJ28rrzSqKWsZZKetKix0q1kq52Xp7K1eceeZLChnKF6r7vTZqqtp6Biwq%2FAyKVkoZ1dna60eceeqWaakZi4br%2FOrqmcnaNiwKLFjGxpbXFnZ3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kristina-wagner.html><span>←</span><span>Kristina Wagner</span></a>
