Peter moved back to Miami, Florida, in 2017 though, and changed his career path a little when he got back to the States, instead changing his focus to commercial real estate. According to a <a href=#>LinkedIn</a> page thought to belong to the former reality star, Peter has been working at Current Capital Group in the sunshine state since he moved back home.&nbsp;</p><p>But Echevarria's firstborn hasn't quite stayed completely out of trouble. <a href=#>Peter made headlines back in January when he was charged with a battery misdemeanor</a> after he was accused of allegedly getting into a physical altercation with his girlfriend at the time.&nbsp;<a href=#>Local 10</a> reported though the following month that the charges against him had been dropped.</p><p>As for his relationship with his famous mom, it seems these two are still pretty close — despite his <a href=#>feud</a> with&nbsp;her husband, Todd Nepola. In August, Peter shared a clip of himself on <a href=#>Instagram</a> dancing alongside Echevarria in a strobe light with some sweet words. "Get yo self a momma like this! These are the moments you appreciate forever. Love you," he captioned the upload.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamljaYNxfI6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkerO0zqZkrKyRp3qiuMSxoJpllZi1psLAq6mimaNiwLC60mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-did-future-do-scottie-pippens-wife.html><span>←</span><span>What Did Future do Scottie Pippens wife?</span></a>
