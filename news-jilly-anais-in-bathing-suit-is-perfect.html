"I definitely love working out!" she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women Fitness</span></a><span>.

I always follow my workouts with going into the sauna for about 15 minutes, which is a great ending to all my work outs."</span></p><p><span>When it comes to her diet, it's all about moderation for Jilly. "I just always watch what I eat. I don't necessarily have a diet that I stick to but I'm very cautious. I eat a lot of fruit and vegetables," she told Women Fitness. "I rarely eat junk food, and maintain a healthy lifestyle."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/pexels-vova-kras-4159894.jpg><p><span>Jilly also prioritizes hydration and avoids sugary drinks.

The </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic </span></a><span>explains that biking, a low-impact aerobic exercise, is great for building muscle, improving strength and flexibility, and improving balance. It can also boost mental health and help other health conditions, including arthritis.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jilly has faither. "I absolutely believe that God plays a huge role in all my success. If it wasn't for him, none of this is possible. And I continue to pray no matter what! Good day I pray and bad day I continue to pray, because I know that without God none of this is possible. I give all my thanks and worship to God each and every day. Walking by faith is the best thing I have ever done. I can only know that God will lead me to much greater paths in my life," she told Women Fitness.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko6GcocZurc2aoKxlmaN6o63ToaCnn12owqrAjKKqZqiVp7Omr9No</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeremy-stoppelman-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Jeremy Stoppelman Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
