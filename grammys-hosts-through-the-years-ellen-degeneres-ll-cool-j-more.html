Between 1959 to 1970, honorees gathered in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, New York City, Nashville and Chicago for the ceremonies.</p><p>When the Grammys eventually changed their format, they became a big hit with audiences at home. Late, great stars <a href=#>Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href=#>Jerry Lewis</a> and <a href=#>Kenny Rogers</a> took the stage to emcee some of the earliest awards shows. As the years went on, movie stars and musicians alike tried their hand at hosting “music’s biggest night.”</p><p>Late singer Andy Williams holds the record for <a href=#>most frequent Grammys host</a> having taken up the role from 1971 to 1977. Following closely behind is LL Cool J, who hosted five ceremonies from 2012 to 2016. When <a href=#><strong>James Corden</strong></a> took over the gig the following year, the NCIS actor was at peace with the choice.</p><p>“They wanted to do something different, and I actually felt totally comfortable with that,” he told <a href=#>Billboard</a> magazine in February 2017. “I had an amazing run on the Grammys. I’m good. I made some great friends, I have friends at the Academy, friends on the production team, the executives.”</p><p>Though the awards often appear to be a well-oiled machine, sometimes things don’t always go as planned. Before she hosted the 62nd annual Grammys from Los Angeles in January 2020, <a href=#><strong>Alicia Keys</strong></a> was forced to make some quick changes to her routine in the wake of <a href=#>Kobe Bryant’s tragic death</a>. She performed an a cappella version of “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday” with Boyz II Men to <a href=#>pay tribute to the NBA player</a> at the Staples Center, where he’d played as a Laker.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think that it was definitely a crazy feeling because, literally minutes before, we were going to do something else,” the “Underdog” singer said on <a href=#>The Ellen DeGeneres Show </a>days after the Grammys took place. “And we had to really figure out how can we properly honor him in his house on this night [with] everybody who adores him and loves him so much and has been inspired by him and felt so devastated in that moment.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at some of the most notable Grammys hosts through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcv6K5zLKqZqCfqMG0edOhqaitl516tbTEZrCemaKoeqa4y56lZpyVnLKvsdGeqmaknGKwsLvLZqFmpZ%2BnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./faline-is-one-in-bambi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Faline is one in Bambi</span></a>
