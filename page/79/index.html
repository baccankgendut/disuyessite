Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
You're here, that's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow.Marius
But you will live, 'Ponine - dear God above...
If I could heal your wounds with words of love...
