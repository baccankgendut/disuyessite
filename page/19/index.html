I’m not at all surprised, because in the late 1970s – when I was a strapping young mother with immense stamina honed by two children under two – I agreed to help a friend clear a stand of bamboo on heavy clay soil in Northamptonshire.</article><article class=post-entry><h2></h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
Long for the blur, we cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt, disgusted with my cheapness
