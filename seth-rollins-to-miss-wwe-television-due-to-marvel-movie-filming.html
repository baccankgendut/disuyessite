Rollins reportedly plays a villain in the film who is a member of the underground "Serpent Society."</p><p>While this role is obviously a great opportunity for Rollins and could potentially lead to even bigger roles in Hollywood, it has a lot of wrestling fans questioning what the future holds for Rollins as a WWE superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the latest edition of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Dave Meltzer reported that Seth Rollins would be missing next week's rendition of Monday Night Raw due to the fact that he'll be on set filming. It is unconfirmed whether Rollins will be able to attend the next episode of Raw, which will be the follow-up episode of Night of Champions.</p><p>WWE introduced the World Heavyweight Championship to help remedy the fact that they don't have a world champion on weekly television due to Roman Reigns' part-time schedule. It would be unfortunate, if not very ironic, if the inaugural World Heavyweight Champion also picked up a part-time due to opportunities in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmejmsGpedGoo6Whnqh6tbuMpqCsq12sxKZ5056jnq6ZqLawuoydrJ5lpKR6rq3Rr5ylZZ2kw6qxjJ%2BgpaWZo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./seafood-businessman-kiyoshi-kimura-pays-half-million-single-fish.html><span>←</span><span>Seafood Businessman Kiyoshi Kimura Pays More Than Half A Million For A Single Fish</span></a>
