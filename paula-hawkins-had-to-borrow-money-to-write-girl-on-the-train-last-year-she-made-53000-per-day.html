That's what happened to Paula Hawkins, the author of The Girl On The Train. Last year she made $53,253 from book and film royalties. Does that not sound like a lot? Oh, that's because we forgot to add that she made $53,253 PER DAY last year. The 45-year-old author went from a struggling, unknown writer to a New York Times bestselling writer nearly overnight. The Girl On The Train&nbsp;was then adapted into a critical and box office hit film starring <a href=# title="Emily Blunt Net Worth">Emily Blunt</a>. Hawkins basically ticked off every box on a writer's bucket list with this one book.</p><p>All in all, <a href=#>Paula Hawkins</a> made $19.4 million in 2017. In 2016, she made $17 million. That's a heck of a turn around for a writer who had to borrow money from her dad so that she could pay the bills, survive and finish writing the book that would make her famous.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-260212 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-860966776.jpg alt width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-260212 class=wp-caption-text>JOHN MACDOUGALL/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>Her earnings are enough to make Hawkins the seventh highest paid author in the world. Oh and according to her corporation's accounting records, she spent $16,774 on clothing and just under $3,600 on books and subscriptions.</p><p>Prior to the success of The Girl On The Train, Hawkins was a struggling financial journalist before writing four chick-lit novels under the pen name Amy Silver. Those books did not make Hawkins enough money to live on. And then she sold an unfinished novel to a publisher. The Girl On The Train&nbsp;was half done when her agent brokered the deal for the story about Rachel, an alcoholic commuter on a train who watches the houses she travels past and becomes obsessed with one of the couples she sees along the way.</p><p>The Girl On The Train&nbsp;became a 2016 film starring Emily Blunt in the role of Rachel. <a href=# title="Justin Theroux Net Worth">Justin Theroux</a>, <a href=# title="Lisa Kudrow Net Worth">Lisa Kudrow</a>, and <a href=# title="Allison Janney Net Worth">Allison Janney</a> had supporting roles in the film. The novel was also turned into a stage play.</p><p>Hawkins was born in Zimbabwe and got her degree at Oxford. She released her second novel Into the Water&nbsp;in 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJop5qtnJZ6qa3WpKCnq12drqV506hkm6eip7y4ecyopZ6xXam8bsPRoqueZZeev615zqdkraCVYsGzrcinZKWZo6l6urHAq2SsoJViuqKwxGZsbGhgZXqxsdFmm5qxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./no-bill-gates-does-not-own-the-majority-of-us-farmland-but-he-does-own-a-lot.html><span>←</span><span>No, Bill Gates Does Not Own The Majority Of US Farmland.
