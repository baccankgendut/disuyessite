<span>Kelle Repass</span></p><h1>Michael Buble Biography and Life Story</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>“Born as Michael Steven Buble on September 9, 1975, when he was heard singing “White Christmas” at the age of 15, Michael Buble had his singing talent discovered by his relatives. He then went to singing class and when he was 16, he had his first on-stage appearance in night clubs. In return for stage spotlight for him, his grandfather, who was a plumber and never stops dreaming that one day he will become a major star, gave free plumbing services.</p><p>Michael won a local contest two years later, however, alas, he was excluded because he was underage. He took part in another series, the Canadian Youth Talent Hunt competition, and was again proclaimed the winner. In 1996, he dropped an independent album named “First Dance” while still unsigned. In 1997, Michael made his first television appearance on Bravo’s documentary “Big Band Boom!” and in 2000 he agreed to give up his dream as a musician.</p><p>Michael had his shot to get signed to a major label before he came back to Vancouver to seek a job as a journalist. This occurred when he was asked to perform at a friend’s wedding and introduced to Grammy-winning producer David Foster. He began recording his self-titled album “Michael Buble” in 2001 after being signed to David’s label and released it in February 2003.<br>Certified platinum, the Billboard Hot 200 album of Michael hit the Top 50 and Australian and New Zealand charts reigned. This effort even allowed him win Best New Artist at the 2004 Juno Awards and at the same event he was nominated for Album of the Year.</p><p>With another studio project named “It’s Time” in 2005, Michael followed the eponymous record, the same year he called off his relationship with long-time girlfriend Debbie Timuss, who he dated long before he asserted his fame. This album was more successful than its precursor. On Billboard Hot 200, it rose to number 7 and dominated at least six other album charts.</p><p>Michael has won four honors, Music Album of the Year, Single of the Year, Record of the Year and Artist of the Year, all of which were Juno Awards from 2006. He was also nominated at the Grammys for the Best Conventional Pop Vocal Performance, but lost to Tony Bennett. He met Emily Blunt and dated her during this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZmLWisctmma6anJp6o7XOoKmaqJiueqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maya-nazor.html><span>←</span><span>Maya Nazor Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth</span></a>
