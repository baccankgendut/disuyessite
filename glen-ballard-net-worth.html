I had a chance to learn about the business of the music business, seeing it at the highest level. I learned how big tours came together, what managers did and didn't do, and I learned about music publishing. And of course getting to be around the creative genius of Elton and all the talented people around him was the biggest education. I didn't ever really meet Elton until I had been there over a year. After three years of working at John Reid's company, I was able to get a publishing deal at MCA Music."</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In the '80s, Glen worked on albums such as Michael Jackson's "Thriller" (1982) and "Bad" (1987), the Pointer Sisters' "Break Out" (1983) and "Hot Together" (1986), Teddy Pendergrass' "Workin' It Back" (1985), and Paula Abdul's "Forever Your Girl" (1988).
